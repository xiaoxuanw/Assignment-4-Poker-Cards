In this file you should include:

Any information you think we should know about your submission
* Is there anything that doesn't work? Why?
At first firebase was acting weird but it was able to connect after all.
* Is there anything that you did that you feel might be unclear? Explain it here.
I was certain with the rules so the algorithms about determining game over might be unclear.
A description of the creative portion of the assignment
* Describe your feature
The user can receive a reset password link by clicking the reset password button on the signin screen
* Why did you choose this feature?
It is useful for an application to have a well-formed signin-out feature that gives the users more
liability to use
* How did you implement it?
I used the featured firebase resend password link function and set an clicklistener to the reset
password button.
